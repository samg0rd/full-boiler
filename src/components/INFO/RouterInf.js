                <p>React Router is the standard routing library for React.</p>
                <p>usually, we need to add it to our projecrts for routing purposes</p>
                <p>so i have already add it to the boiler plate and built a simple header navigation with it so you can examine it all</p>
                <p><strong>BrowserRouter</strong> has been imported and used in the root index.js file</p>
                <p>and in App.js file i defined Routes ( and also links as an array of objects -- want more on that? click on navigation from the list above ) </p>
